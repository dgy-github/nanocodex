"""Storyboard pipeline: story text + images -> shots -> Seedance payloads -> video.

Seven stages, run in order by :func:`run_pipeline`. Each stage is a small pure-ish
function ``(state, deps) -> state`` that returns a NEW state (the running project
dict), mirroring the project's pure-logic house style (agent/schedule.py). The
only side effects live behind ``deps`` (the three injected clients) and the final
export write, so the whole thing runs offline in tests with fake clients.

Stages (matching the user's spec):
    1. ingest         - validate input, build the working state
    2. analyze_assets - VisionAnalyzer per image -> asset_analysis
    3. plan_storyboard- TextPlanner over story_text -> shots
    4. map_assets     - RULE-BASED: attach background/character images per shot
                        (embedding matching is a seam left for later)
    5. build_payloads - assemble one Seedance payload per shot
    6. render         - SeedanceClient per shot -> video_url   (OPT-IN, costs money)
    7. export         - write asset_analysis / storyboard / payloads json + urls

The render stage is OFF by default: Seedance bills real money per clip, so a
caller must explicitly pass ``render=True``.

"""Tests for the scheduler's desktop-only approver (Direction B security core).

A scheduled task marked ``allow_desktop=True`` runs unattended under
``_desktop_only_approver`` instead of the default ``_auto_deny_approver``. The
WHOLE security claim rests on one invariant: that approver may grant ONLY
desktop (MCP) actions — never a shell command, never an out-of-sandbox file
write. These tests prove both halves END TO END through the real gates
(McpTool._gate_decision and ShellTool.execute), not just the callback in
isolation, so a future refactor that widens the hole trips a red test.

Offline: the remote MCP tool and the shell executor are faked; no desktop is
touched, no command actually runs.

"""Tests for the GUI managed scheduler's pure decision helpers.

These two functions hold the WHOLE security posture of the GUI-hosted scheduler
(Direction A) in Tk-free, clock-free form, so they're unit-tested exhaustively:

* ``_scheduler_run_plan`` maps (allow_desktop, mcp_connected) -> (approver_kind,
  attach_mcp_tools). The safety invariant — a task without allow_desktop gets the
  auto-deny approver AND no desktop tools at all — is locked here.
* ``_format_scheduler_log_entry`` formats the one record an unattended run
  leaves (runs never touch the transcript), with the timestamp injected so it's
  deterministic.
